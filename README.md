# Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained machine learning model to a specific task or dataset by training it further on domain-specific data. This process leverages the model's existing knowledge, requiring fewer resources compared to training from scratch. Fine-tuning enhances the model's performance in specialized tasks by adjusting its weights using labeled data.

Example Use Case:
Fine-tuning a language model on a custom dataset of financial Q&A pairs to improve its accuracy and relevance when answering domain-specific questions.


# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines information retrieval techniques with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses. It works in two main steps:

* Retrieve: Search for relevant documents or context from an external knowledge base (e.g., a database or corpus) based on a given query.
* Generate: Use the retrieved information as input to a generative model (like GPT) to produce contextually accurate and informed responses.

Example Workflow:

* A user asks a question.
* The RAG system retrieves related passages from a knowledge base (e.g., financial documents).
* The retrieved content is fed to a language model, which generates a detailed answer based on both the question and the retrieved context.

# Why Use Fine-Tuning and RAG?
* Fine-Tuning: Tailors the model for specific use cases, enhancing its domain expertise and accuracy.
* RAG: Dynamically integrates external knowledge into responses, overcoming the limitations of static model training and ensuring up-to-date and context-aware outputs.
